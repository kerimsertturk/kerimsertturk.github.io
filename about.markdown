<div class = "about-me-text">
My name is Kerim Sertturk. I am an Electrical Engineering student graduating from University of British Columbia in May 2020.<br><br>
I am primarily interested in Machine Learning models and their application in computer vision and business decision-making. In terms of intellectual hobbies, I like psychology and political science.<br><br>
In this blog I share new concepts that I learn as well as updates from my capstone project.
