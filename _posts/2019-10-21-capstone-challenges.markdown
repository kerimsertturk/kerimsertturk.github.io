<!--
3 categories of approaches for particle-picking:
Generative: Generative approaches measure the similarity between regions of the micrograph and 2D projections of a reference structure. Known as template-matching techniques.
Discriminative: Binary classifier require positive and negative samples in training data. Can be done by fully-supervised way, machine learning or iterative supervised way.
Unsupervised: without reference, statistical measures and features obtained directly from micrographs.
