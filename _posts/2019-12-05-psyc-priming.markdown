'Social Priming' or 'Behavioral Priming' is the process of exposing a subject with stimulus words or images, which influence their response on a particular matter related to the stimulus. It originated in the 70s when psychologists found that people can better recognize words if they were primed before. For instance, subjects recognized the word 'nurse' faster after seeing semantically related words such as 'doctor' in prior.

The discovery of priming allowed researchers to observe behavioral differences among people to understand the effects of various social phenomena. The common methodolgy is having two groups: one not primed and one primed. Researchers can then observe differences between the two and discuss the potential affects of the issue at hand on people's behavior and social interactions.

Many studies over the past decades have utilized priming to conduct experiments. To name a few, a widely-cited article in 2006 conducted an experiment in which two groups were tasked to make sentences off of scrambled words. One group was given neutral, everyday sentences, whereas the other group was primed with words relating to money such as "high-paying salary". They were then asked to solve a puzzle with an option to ask for help at any point. The results showed that the primed group asked for help, on average, two and a half minutes later than the non-primed control group. The reserchers concluded that being exposed to stimulus about money made people more self-reliant and even made them put physical distance between themselves and a new acquaintance. [1]

Another recent study hypothesized that individuals with strong moral identities generated and appreciated less humor. In one of the experiments, researchers "activated" participants' moral identity by priming them with a list of moral traits such as honest, kind, fair, etc. They found that participants whose morality was "activated" by priming generated less humor than the non-primed controlled group. The paper concluded with further experiments that a strong sense of morality can impede one's ability to appreciate and generate humor, which can have negative social effects especially in the workplace.[2]

Countless studies have utilized priming as a source of studying behavioral effects of a psychological phenomenon within a controlled, laboratory-like environment that has been considered academically valid if conducted properly. Researchers and even authors of popular books have consistenly referred to studies done with priming as final verdict. However, recent developments are challenging the notion that priming can be solely attributed to shaping people's unconscious behavior. Many attempts to replicate early studies, including the aforementioned money experiment, have failed and researchers weren't able to verify the results. Failure of replications occurs often in other areas as well, but priming is an area where it has happens many times [3] A possible explanation for the failure of replication is that after decades of  experiments with priming, people may simply be aware that they are being primed. Best-selling books like *Thinking, Fast and Slow* and *Predictably Irrational* have made references to social studies, explaining the process of priming. These books have been read by millions of people globally to better understand themselves, succeed in their careers and advance their knowledge. As such it is perfectly possible that subjects of replicated experiments are somewhat familiar with psychological studies and the methods employed through.

A major issue - not exclusive to psychology and social studies - is the manipulaion of data to fit the hypothesis or hypothesizing based on the results of data. Reported results may be statistical noise or work only for the small sample of people that participated in the experiment, instead of being the underlying mechanism that governs people's behaviour. Researchers still report those findings, sometimes not being aware themselves that the results don't apply universally. It is also common practice among researchers to ‘HARK’ (Hypothesize After Results are Known) in which arguments are shaped based on data, which is especially problematic if the data itself is incorrectly analyzed or is over-fit to the sample group. [3] There is also evidence that when experimenters were aware of the priming effect they were looking for, they were much more likely to find it, suggesting that, subconsciously, they would affect the results. [3]

However, despite recent skepticism, priming can still explain some behavioral effects. For instance, a 2008 study reported that holding warm coffee made people behave more warmly towards others.[4] Even though direct replication of the study has failed, other experiments - including neuroimaging - have showed positive correlation between the two. It would be very frustrating for researchers to declare all their previous work invalid just because priming studies can't be replicated, however it is important not to turn a blind eye to the possibility that there may be factors - other than priming - that affect the results.
